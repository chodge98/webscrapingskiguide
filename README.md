# webscrapingskiguide
Used Selenium Webdriver with Python to scrape Evo.com to create an up to date dictionary of skis on the market organized by profile, function, gender, and skier level. The created dictionary was then used in a front end program to assign three pairs of skis to the user based on their inputted specifications.  The front end also gave information on ski length and boot sizing based on user input.
